# 🚀 Dev Environment Setup with Ansible

This repository contains an Ansible playbook for setting up a development environment with Zsh, Tmux, Neovim/LunarVim, custom aliases, and configuration for each component. The playbook is compatible with both Debian/Ubuntu (APT) and Fedora/CentOS (YUM/DNF) systems.

## Prerequisites 📋

- Ansible 2.9 or higher.
- Target systems must be either Debian/Ubuntu or Fedora/CentOS based.
- SSH access to the target systems.
- Sudo privileges on the target systems.

## Getting Started 🚦

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine or Ansible control node.

```bash
git clone [Your Repository URL]
cd [Your Repository Name]
```
1. Configure Inventory (optional): Edit the inventory file to include the IP addresses or hostnames of the target machines.

```bash
[dev]
192.168.1.100
192.168.1.101
```
Replace the IP addresses with those of your target machines.

2. Customize Aliases and Configurations: Modify alias_list.yml and config.lua as needed to fit your preferences.

3. Run the Playbook: Execute the Ansible playbook. Ensure you have the necessary SSH access and privileges.

```
ansible-playbook -i user@$IP, playbook.yml
```
or 
```
ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml
```
You might need to provide additional flags depending on your setup, such as `--user`, `--ask-become-pass`, etc.

## What’s Inside the Playbook? 🧰

The `playbook.yml` performs the following tasks:

- Updates the package cache on the target systems.
- Installs development tools like Git, Zsh, Tmux, and development libraries.
- Installs Python development packages. 🐍
- Sets up Oh My Zsh for an enhanced shell experience.
- Gets Neovim/LunarVim ready for advanced text editing 📝
- Sets up custom aliases from `alias_list.yml`.
- Applies custom configurations for Zsh, Tmux, and LunarVim.

## Customizations 🎨

Feel like tweaking things? Dive into:

- `alias_list.yml`: Define your own shell aliases here.
